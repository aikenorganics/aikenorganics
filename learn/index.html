      <h1>Delivery</h1>
      <p>
        We can deliver anywhere in the city limits (eventually we would love to
        deliver further out). You can choose to have items delivered to your work
        or home. It is recommended to be present to make sure your items are stored
        properly. If you choose home delivery and you are not at home please have a
        cooler by your front door to store your items. If there are no
        accommodations for your items then you will need to pick up your order at
        Magnolia's.

      <h1>Why Local</h1>
      <p>
        Local food systems rely upon a network of small, usually sustainably
        run, family farms (rather than large industrially run farms) as the source of
        farm products.  Industrial farming negatively impacts the environment in
        countless ways (e.g., by polluting the air, surface water, and groundwater,
        over-consuming fossil fuel and water resources, degrading soil quality,
        inducing erosion, and accelerating the loss of biodiversity).  Industrial
        agriculture also adversely affects the health of farm workers, degrades the
        socioeconomic fabric of surrounding communities, and impairs the health and
        quality of life of community residents.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, although the concept of
        “food miles” (i.e., the number of miles a food item travels from farm to
        consumer) has been criticized as an unreliable indicator of the environmental
        impact of industrially produced food, it should be noted that conventional food
        is estimated to typically travel between 1,500 and 3,000 miles to reach the
        consumer and usually requires additional packaging and refrigeration. Many
        small-scale, local farms attempt to ameliorate the environmental damage done
        via industrial farming by focusing on sustainable practices, such as minimized
        pesticide use, no-till agriculture and composting, minimized transport to
        consumers, and minimal to no packaging for their farm products. when you eat
        local, naturally grown food, you are truly doing your body, mind, community and
        favor!
