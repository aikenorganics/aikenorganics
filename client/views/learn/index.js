          <h1>Why Local?</h1>
          <p>
            Local food systems rely upon a network of small, usually sustainably
            ran, family farms (rather than large industrially run farms) as the
            source of farm products. Industrial farming negatively impacts the
            environment in countless ways (e.g., by polluting the air, surface
            water, and groundwater, over-consuming fossil fuel and water resources,
            degrading soil quality, inducing erosion, and accelerating the loss of
            biodiversity). Industrial agriculture also adversely affects the health
            of farm workers, degrades the socioeconomic fabric of surrounding
            communities, and impairs the health and quality of life of community
            residents. In addition, although the concept of “food miles” (i.e., the
            number of miles a food item travels from farm to consumer) has been
            criticized as an unreliable indicator of the environmental impact of
            industrially produced food, it should be noted that conventional food
            is estimated to typically travel between 1,500 and 3,000 miles to reach
            the consumer and usually requires additional packaging and
            refrigeration. Many small-scale, local farms attempt to ameliorate the
            environmental damage done via industrial farming by focusing on
            sustainable practices, such as minimized pesticide use, no-till
            agriculture and composting, minimized transport to consumers, and
            minimal to no packaging for their farm products. When you eat local,
            naturally grown food, you are truly doing your body, mind, community
            and favor!

          <h1>Standards</h1>
          <p>
            Aiken Organics is passionate about the quality of food we offer. We
            have high standards for our Growers and Producers to ensure the healthiest, and
            safest items for our ourselves and customers:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><p>All products must be either organic or naturally grown/raised.</p></li>
            <li><p>No chemical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, antibiotics, hormones, or GMOs.</p></li>
            <li><p>Occasionally, items are offered, particularly at the wholesale level, that are conventionally grown. These are clearly labeled so as a consumer, you are making a conscious and informed choice.</p></li>
            <li><p>All canned items must use local produce that meets the same standards as the produce.</p></li>
            <li><p>All items must be grown and produced directly by the seller.</p></li>
            <li><p>Any cooked item must be prepared in a DHEC approved kitchen and/or approved by the department of agriculture.</p></li>
            <li><p>All prepared foods and desserts and sweets must use as many local, naturally produced ingredients as possible. We realize that there is no such things as locally produced sugar, so we retain a bit of flexibility for our cooks and bakers. However we do work with them to ensure that their items align as closely as possible to our standards for produce, and that none of their items contain GMOs or artificial ingredients.</p></li>

          <h1>FAQ</h1>

          <a id='how-do-i-join' className='anchor' />
          <h2>How do I join?</h2>
          <p>Fill out the form on the <Link href='/signup'>sign up</Link> page and begin shopping!</p>

          <a id='membership-fees' className='anchor' />
          <h2>Are there membership fees?</h2>
          <p>
						Yes, we ask that you pay a one time fee of $29. You are welcome to
						try us for two orders before officially becoming members.  We are
						not a retail shop. We do not purchase items from local growers,
						mark them up, and then resell them. You purchase things directly
						from the growers and producers. Everything is picked or made fresh
						for you. The sellers set the price, and that is the price you pay,
						similar to a farmers market. For that reason, the membership fee
						keeps Aiken Organics going! It is an alternative business model,
						with a priority on making local food viable for growers and
						producers. Customers are getting local food at the lowest possible
						price, set by the farmers themselves.
          </p>

          <a id='buy-what-you-want' className='anchor' />
          <h2>Will I have to buy vegetables I don't want?</h2>
          <p>
            Unlike some co-ops or CSAs, at Aiken Organics you get to order what
            you want, how much you want and from the farms that you want. We have certain
            standards for our products/sellers on our website. A weekly email will be sent
            of items available in our market.
          </p>

          <a id='how-do-i-order' className='anchor' />
          <h2>How do I order?</h2>
          <p>
            Every Sunday at 8am, a list of available products is sent to all of
            our registered customers via e-mail. Customers must place their order for the
            week no later than Wednesday at noon. Orders can be placed here on our website.
          </p>

          <a id='when-do-i-pay' className='anchor' />
          <h2>When do I pay?</h2>
          <p>
            We do not accept advance payment on the website right now. We accept
            payment when you pick up your order. Because we may have to adjust your total,
            there are sometimes unexpected changes that need to be made to orders between
            the time you order and the time you pick up, such as weather damage, inaccurate
            quantity prediction, or a farmer unable to deliver. These situations will be
            rare, but occasionally may happen. When they do, we need to make changes to
            your order so you are not charged for items you are not receiving. Also, some
            items are priced by the pound (meat). It makes life easier to adjust orders at
            time of pick-up.
          </p>

          <a id='pick-up' className='anchor' />
          <h2>When and Where do I pick up my order?</h2>
          <p>
            You pick up your order on Thursday from 3-6:30pm at The Alley Downtown Taproom;
            214 The Alley; Aiken, South Carolina 29801.
          </p>

          <a id='not-picked-up' className='anchor' />
          <h2>Am I still charged for my order if I do not pick it up?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. The growers harvested for you and Aiken Organics paid the
            growers on your behalf when they brought your order to the market. This makes
            you responsible for paying for items, even if you do not pick them up. This
            amount will be added to your next order. We will make effort to contact you if
            you have not picked up your order about 30 minutes prior to pick-up time
            ending. If an unforeseen circumstance comes up and you know you'll not be able
            to pick up your order, you're welcome to send a friend, or just send us an
            email and we'll work with you to figure out a convenient time.
          </p>
