`Plan It Foods offers homemade “heat and serve” meals that focus on local, all
natural ingredients. Our frozen meals come in single serving or family sizes
and are fully cooked and ready to heat in your oven. We use only chemical-free,
hormone-free, antibiotic-free meats, milk and eggs from local farmers using
sustainable & humane practices in the raising and butchering of their animals.
We also offer gluten free, vegetarian and vegan menu options and use as much
local produce as possible from local farmers who are following organic growing
practices. We are fully licensed and insured and all of our prepared foods are
made in a DHEC approved kitchen. We strive to use the freshest, healthiest,
best tasting local products available so that you do not have to sacrifice
taste or nutrition for convenience!`

`Happy Earth Farm is your local Aiken family farm, where we’re dedicated to
providing you with the freshest products in the purest fashion. We don’t use
pesticides, herbicides or any other “cides”! We grow our crops using our own
organic compost and other organic supplements and soil enhancers; we practice
extensive crop rotation and companion planting; our flock of guineas provides
natural pest control; and we never, ever use genetically modified seeds! We
raise our chickens the old fashioned way: providing unadulterated, soy-free
organic feed and offering up plenty of fresh air and sunshine. We’re
passionate about “clean” healthy eating, and we offer to you what we feed our
family: fresh and natural alternatives to store-bought fare.`
